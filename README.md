# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
For this project my motivation was the desire to have a stronger start in the coding bootcamp. I had built this project so I could learn the basics in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have a page that makes taking and reading notes easier. The problem this project solved was having notes that were messy, organized, and difficult to navigate. Throughout the process of building my project I learned how to design a simple webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
